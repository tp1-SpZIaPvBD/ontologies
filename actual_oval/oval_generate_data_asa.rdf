The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the code that handles session information for the SSL VPN when a SharePoint handler is created. A SharePoint handler is created when a valid SharePoint connection is initiated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected system. The SSL VPN feature must be configured for the system to be vulnerable.  An exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite arbitrary files on the RAMFS cache or inject Lua scripts, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition for the Clientless SSL VPN portal or causing the system to reload.  This vulnerability was reported to Cisco by Alec Stuart-Muirk." ;

The vulnerability is due to improper implementation of the tunnel group selection when a user authenticates to the remote access VPN via the challenge-response mechanism. This vulnerability may affect Cisco ASA configured to authenticate remote access VPN users via LDAP, RADIUS, TACACS+, and RSA if a challenge-response is needed for authentication. Cisco ASA Software configured for Clientless or AnyConnect SSL VPN is affected by this vulnerability.  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a response to the Cisco ASA with a different tunnel group parameter. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass the tunnel group restriction and authenticate to a different tunnel group than the one selected during the authentication phase. This could result in accessing a different set of resources." ;
