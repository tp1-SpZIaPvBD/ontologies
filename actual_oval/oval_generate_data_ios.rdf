    ns1:hasDescription "Cisco IOS contains a vulnerability in the VLAN Trunking Protocol (VTP) that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition.  The vulnerability exists because the VTP feature in several versions of Cisco IOS software does not properly handle malformed packets sent from the local network. An attacker residing on the local network segment could exploit this vulnerability via a crafted summary packet to cause a DoS condition.  Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security advisory and released updated software to correct it.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must reside on the local network segment and send a crafted summary packet to a device supporting VTP. The device must be configured as either client or server for VTP. Additionally, the packets must be received on a trunk enabled port. Switches configured with a VTP domain password are still affected.  The switch receiving the packet generates syslog messages for either watchdog timeout or CPU hog for process VLAN Manager prior to the software reset. Exploitation causes a DoS condition only until the device reboots. Repeated attacks could cause an extended DoS condition." ;

The vulnerability exists due to improper input validation by the VTP feature of Cisco IOS. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious VTP summary advertisement to an affected system. This action could result in a buffer overflow, resetting the affected system or allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.  Cisco confirmed this vulnerability in a security response and released updated software.  To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to craft a VTP summary advertisement packet that specifies a domain that matches the domain of the target system. This knowledge may be difficult for an external attacker to determine. Additionally, the attacker must send the packet in such a way that it arrives at the target system on a trunk enabled port. To do this, the attacker must determine an appropriate destination address for a vulnerable target. Depending on local network configuration, reaching the target system on a trunk enabled port may limit the systems from which the attacker can stage an attack.  Because standard suggested practice is to set a VTP domain password, the attacker must also know or guess this password to exploit this  vulnerability." ;

Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security advisory and has released updated software.  Only devices that use Gambino DSP components are vulnerable. Devices with different DSP components, or those without the component, are unaffected.  To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must send malicious network requests to affected devices.

This action could result in a buffer overflow, resetting the affected system or allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.  Cisco confirmed this vulnerability in a security response and released updated software.  To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to craft a VTP summary advertisement packet that specifies a domain that matches the domain of the target system. This knowledge may be difficult for an external attacker to determine. Additionally, the attacker must send the packet in such a way that it arrives at the target system on a trunk enabled port. To do this, the attacker must determine an appropriate destination address for a vulnerable target. Depending on local network configuration, reaching the target system on a trunk enabled port may limit the systems from which the attacker can stage an attack.  Because standard suggested practice is to set a VTP domain password, the attacker must also know or guess this password to exploit this  vulnerability." ;

The vulnerability exists because the VTP feature in several versions of Cisco IOS software does not properly handle malformed packets sent from the local network. An attacker residing on the local network segment could exploit this vulnerability via a crafted summary packet to cause a DoS condition.  Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security advisory and released updated software to correct it.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must reside on the local network segment and send a crafted summary packet to a device supporting VTP. The device must be configured as either client or server for VTP. Additionally, the packets must be received on a trunk enabled port. Switches configured with a VTP domain password are still affected.  The switch receiving the packet generates syslog messages for either watchdog timeout or CPU hog for process VLAN Manager prior to the software reset. Exploitation causes a DoS condition only until the device reboots. Repeated attacks could cause an extended DoS condition." ;

    ns1:hasDescription "Cisco IOS running on Catalyst 6500 and Cisco 7600 contains a vulnerability that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured ACLs.  The vulnerability exists because the affected devices accept traffic to IP addresses that are reserved for use by the Ethernet Out-of-Band Channel (EOBC). These addresses are not typically protected by ACLs, as they are not expected to be reachable outside the EOBC. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability to bypass ACLs configured to protect exposed management addresses and send packets to intelligent modules such as the Supervisor or Multi-layer Switch Feature Card (MSFC).  Exploit code is not required to exploit this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security response and released updated software.  The vulnerability affects Catalyst 6500 and Cisco 7000 devices that are running in both Hybrid Mode (CatOS on the Supervisor Engine and IOS on the MSFC) and Native Mode (IOS on both the Supervisor Engine and the MSFC). The 127.0.0.0/8 network is reserved for loopback and internal communications, as specified in RFC 3330[\"http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3330.html\"]. As such, traffic bound for this network is not routed over the public Internet. However, some default configurations of IOS running on Cisco Routers may allow such traffic to pass over trusted internal networks. The circumstances that would allow this are very specific and are unlikely to occur in most networks. These factors dramatically lower the pool of potential  attackers. Any attacker that bypasses ACLs using this vulnerability to access an affected device must still authenticate to perform actions such as modifying configuration files.  Multiple methods exist to effectively mitigate this vulnerability without downtime or software upgrades. Administrators of high availability environments are advised to utilize ACLs or Control Plane Policing (CoPP) to prevent unwanted traffic from reaching intelligent management cards. Administrators are still encouraged to update the software running on these devices during the next scheduled and planned outage.  This vulnerability has been resolved with the release of 12.2(33)SXH." ;

This vulnerability exists due to an integer overflow error within the statistics counters. An authenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a spoofed VTP summary packet to the affected device, causing the VTP statistics parameter to wrap to a negative number. This condition could prevent the affected device from processing further configuration changes. Under some circumstances, this could prevent the device from responding to further requests, resulting in a DoS  condition.  Cisco has confirmed this vulnerability in a security response and released updated software to correct it.  To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must have access to the local network to spoof the malicious request. Additionally, VTP configurations that use an authentication password within the VTP domain will require the attacker to know the domain password to successfully exploit the vulnerability. Only devices with valid VTP configurations are affected by this vulnerability." ;
