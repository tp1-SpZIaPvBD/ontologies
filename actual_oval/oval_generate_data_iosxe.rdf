To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker who can authenticate to an affected device may submit a specific, valid SNMP request. A successful exploit will cause the supervisor card that serviced the request to restart, due to an attempt to access an invalid memory region, and result in a DoS condition." ;

The vulnerability exists due to changes in the implementation of the BGP MPLS-Based Ethernet VPN RFC (RFC 7432) [\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7432\"] draft between IOS XE software releases. When the BGP Inclusive Multicast Ethernet Tag Route or BGP EVPN MAC/IP Advertisement Route update packet is received, it could be possible that the IP address length field is miscalculated. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted BGP packet to an affected device after the BGP session was established. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload or corrupt the BGP routing table; either outcome would result in a DoS.  The Cisco implementation of the BGP protocol only accepts incoming BGP traffic from explicitly defined peers. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be able to send the malicious packets over a TCP connection that appears to come from a trusted BGP peer, or inject malformed messages into the victim's BGP network. This would require obtaining information about the BGP peers in the affected system's trusted network.  The vulnerability may be triggered when the router receives a crafted BGP message from a peer on an existing BGP session. At least one BGP neighbor session must be established for a router to be vulnerable." ;

The attacker is then able to authenticate to the legitimate TLS server and thus stage a man-in-the-middle attack. However, the attacker would not be able to view the contents of the session and would only be able to inject data or requests into it.  Proof-of-concept code that exploits this vulnerability is publicly available.  OpenSSL has confirmed this vulnerability in a changelog and released updated software.  To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to intercept traffic from a TLS client to a TLS server. In many cases, this may require the attacker to have access to a network that is adjacent to the targeted user's system.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of malformed IKE packets by the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IKE packets to a device configured with features that leverage IKE version 1 (IKEv1).  Although IKEv1 is automatically enabled on a Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software when IKEv1 or IKE version 2 (IKEv2) is configured, the vulnerability can be triggered only by sending a malformed IKEv1 packet.  In specific conditions, normal IKEv1 packets can also cause an affected release of Cisco IOS Software to leak memory.  Only IKEv1 is affected by this vulnerability.  An exploit could cause Cisco IOS Software not to release allocated memory, causing a memory leak. A sustained attack may result in a device reload." ;

    ns1:hasDescription "A vulnerability in the quality of service (QoS) subsystem of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition or execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.  The vulnerability is due to incorrect bounds checking of certain values in packets that are destined for UDP port 18999 of an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious packets to an affected device. When the packets are processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition may occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device with elevated privileges. The attacker could also leverage this vulnerability to cause the device to reload, causing a temporary DoS condition while the device is reloading.  The malicious packets must be destined to and processed by an affected device. Traffic transiting a device will not trigger the vulnerability." ;

A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the affected device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have access to the management interface of the affected software, which is typically connected to a restricted management network." ;

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by making an ISDN call to an affected device and sending traffic through the ISDN channel prior to successful PPP authentication. Alternatively, an unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending traffic through an affected device that is configured to exit via an ISDN connection for which both the Dialer interface and the Basic Rate Interface (BRI) have been configured, but the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) password for PPP does not match the remote end.

The vulnerability is due to improper validation of parameters in a Flexible NetFlow Version 9 record. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malformed Flexible NetFlow Version 9 packet to the Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) data port of an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to trigger an infinite loop, resulting in a process crash that would cause a reload of the device.
